<p>We start by solving the corresponding quadratic equation by using the discriminant:</p>
{discr}
<p>The discriminant equals {discr-val}.</p>
<p>The roots can be found as follows: </p>
{eq-sols}
<p>For these $x$-values, the value of the quadractic equation becomes 0. To know when the equation is larger than 0, we draw a sign table:</p>
{signtable}
<p>The solution for this quadratic inequality is: {ineq-sols}.</p>
