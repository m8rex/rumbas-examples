<p>It is wrong to</p>
<ul>
  <li>simplify two fractions crosswise when you are adding them.</li>
  <li>add the numerator and add the denominator when you are adding two fractions
    <ul>
      <li>this is different from the product of fractions where you multiply the numerators of the fractions and the denominators of the fractions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The only way the correctly add fractions is to make the denominators equal before adding the numerators.</p>
